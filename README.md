Assignment 1: Style Your Recipe Page
Objective: Apply fundamental CSS to the HTML recipe page you built to make it visually appealing and readable.

Instructions:
Create a CSS file named styles.css and link it to your recipe.html file.

Layout & Spacing:

Set a maximum width for the entire page content and center it on the screen.

Add comfortable padding inside the content area.

Typography & Color:

Choose a web-safe font for the body text and a different, complementary font for the headings.

Establish a color scheme (e.g., background color, text color, and an accent color for headings).

Styling Elements:

Style the lists: remove default bullet points from the ingredients list and add a custom margin to the instruction steps.

Style the image: ensure it is not too wide, has a border, and is centered.

Visual Hierarchy:

Use different font sizes, weights, and colors to create a clear visual distinction between headings, paragraphs, and list items.

Deliverable: Your updated recipe.html file and a styles.css file.

Assignment 2: Build a Responsive Profile Card
Objective: Build and style a reusable component using core CSS concepts, including Flexbox and media queries.

Instructions:
Create a new profile_card.html file and a linked card_styles.css file.
Core Styling (Mobile-First):

Style the .profile-card with a background color, shadow, rounded corners, and internal padding.

Style the image to be a perfect circle.

Use Flexbox with a column direction to stack the card's elements vertically and center-align the text.

Interactivity & Responsiveness:

Add a hover effect to the card (e.g., slightly lift it by changing its shadow).

Style the button with a background color that changes on hover.

Use a media query so that on screens wider than 600px, the card's maximum width increases.

Deliverable: Two files: profile_card.html and card_styles.css.
